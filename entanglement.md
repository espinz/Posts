When I stop to think, I wonder if I have lost my â€” mind. The goal was to move from Jekyll, a Ruby based framework, to Hexo, a JavaScript based framework; the reasoning behind this was to familiarize myself with JavaScript. I completed the transition; not so much the familiarization. The main question, that has me questioning myself today, is "am I really entangling JavaScript, Python and Bash?".

Well, yes and no: I was moving some of my scripts, from Bash to Python, and now I have a mixed sort of scripts in all three languages. I never thought I'd see the day. The scary part is that I think I am starting to like it!
