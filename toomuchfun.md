I couldn't resist. What can I say — I'm weak!: I setup a GNS3 network topology!

For some context, I will explain how this happened. I started reading about something called CCNA Routing and Switching (Cisco Certified Network Associate). I seen some videos of people using a virtual network simulator called GNS3. Call it fate, coincidence or a small world but I was working with Python and pyQT just last week; GNS3 is built with python and pyQT. I didn't feel the need to write about what I was working on because it was, and still is, an experimental side project for this site. I am still using dialog for bash, and some python; and right now, it is still a spaghetti of a mess that I am scared to touch at the moment. So, I decided to relieve some stress and connect a router, switch and two computers. Simple enough, right?

# Summary
So far I'm trying to juggle bash, python, pyQT, Linux+, and now CCNA? If I were to rate which one is considered play and which is considered work I would say, from play to work, networking (because I love hardware — I think), GNU/Linux then Programming. I will be honest. I am lazy. I hate working hence why my programming is always — ```infinity=∞; sleep $infinity```?

I claimed I would drop everything and only work/play (it is work/play because it is in the middle of my rating system) for the Linux+ exam but failed to balance it all this week. 

To justify my networking play, I suppose it could be viewed as a little reward for working so hard; and if that is the case, I should probably get back to ~studying~ "working" so I can accrue more playing time.
