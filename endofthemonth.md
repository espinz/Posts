I had a record number of post this month!

<!--more-->

This would be my twelfth post in the month of June. I have changed the layout and added images and everything seems to be working. As July comes around I will work on internal modifications. I would also like to start some home automation and raspberry pi projects. I am thinking about getting a raspberry pi 4 but only after I utilized the one I will be working on first. It would be nice to rush out and have one laying around but that is not very useful. I currently have a few ideas write down in my journal and many things I would like to accomplish but I need to squeeze the clock for some more time. Until then, I keep the back burners warm.
