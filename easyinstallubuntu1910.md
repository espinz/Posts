Just installed  Ubuntu 19.10 via VMware easy install. The reason behind the installation is for practice labs. Ubuntu 19.10 might be a little too new for practice labs but we will see. Speaking of seeing, watch me set and unset an environment variable on the newly installed OS! 

**BONUS**: the output of `set` and `export` are sent through named pipes.
