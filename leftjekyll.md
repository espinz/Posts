I was thinking, aka working, on my tags. Then I found Hexo. I stumbled on it via [https://www.staticgen.com/](staticgen). I even found a bash blog on there. I would like to practice some more javascript so I decided to leave ruby and try Hexo. This is what I wanted and it has already been done. So I switched.
