Major site outrage. A huge special thanks to git! I was able to recover. Also, today I started using long commit messages on the development server. I was adding comments into the scripts but figured it was starting to look ugly; that and I was adding dates manually. Git can take care of all of that in the git logs. I'm actually scared to look at the git logs. I have so many commits it is not even funny; that and it is automated, so you know it is long. On second thought, let me peak.

`git log --oneline| wc -l`

only 43 commits... not too bad. I will rebase later. The only thing that concerns me is if the longer commits will get lost in the shuffle.
