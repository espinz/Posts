I have been thinking: I might change my layout — again. Because this week I have visited multiple blogs with two column layouts; and I really like it. One blog that blew my mind was how simple it felt. It had this "slowed downed" feeling to it. This has inspired me to rethink how I write my posts. I plan to start the new style this month.

About the new, or changed, layout; I might keep what I have now and just change the code base a bit because that is what we are suppose to do — right? After all, it is feeling a little off the shelf.
