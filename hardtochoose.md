Everything time I have to choose between KDE or Gnome I freeze. I like both but let me take an honest second to pick. I always go with KDE. I like the foot but why do I always go KDE? There is something about it that I can not quite grasp. Is it the layout? Maybe. Is it the macOS look like themes? Maybe. It has to be the Konsole. What ever it is it just feels different. It is odd how it really does feel different. Windows, macOS and all the GNU/Linux distros have a certain feel to them.

I will have to get to the bottom of this feeling. It could be the code. Maybe it is the entanglement between software and hardware. Well, all this gives me an idea for a new post. Battle between the OS's! With different hardware I am not sure how it will be fair. Fun thought though.
