It is the end of the month; and when I look back, I can proudly say that I have come a long way in regards to coding, reading and developing a new perception. I suppose that is the purpose of learning something new: to obtain a new perception. Well, the summer is coming to an end and I would say it is time to give a little more effort as a way to finish off strong. Lets push and finish the summer of 2019!
