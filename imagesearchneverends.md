I am still working on the image search script. What am I doing exactly? I am writing a script to auto insert images. I was scanning my posts for nouns and basing the images off of that; it did not work out so well. The problem was that the nouns were too random. So I opted for a keyword prompt to better match the posts; the prompt is still to random. I will go back to the noun searching script later. Maybe some day I will work on machine learning for better searches â€” A life goal.
