> Spring cleaning, Summer air out, Fall sweeping?

This site has three errors: dead URL links which read 404. I find it very strange because the on the development server everything is up and running. I suppose it's a perfect time to say "it works on my machine!". Maybe a force update will help it recover because I am at a complete lost on this one. 

# Checklist
* The html is present
* The hyperlink is correct
* It works on the development server
* Force update?

# Update
Force update didn't work. I figured it would have no effect since all I was doing is uploading the same error. Since everything is working on the dev server, I had to look for clues. I came up with Capitalization. The post that were causing errors had capitals in their URLs. I gave all of them lower case names. Ideally, I would like to rename all the URLs into something more simple; keeping the date and only changing the long winded path names.

**Why** not now? Because I don't want to mess with googles indexing. Maybe I should do it now and have google re-index the site map now than later. Also, changing some script code in the process. Sure why not. Can I do it all before the next day? After reviewing what needs to be done. I would rather not rush it. Hexo stores all the files in one directory. I can't have multiple files with the same name. I will have to create I file checker before each new entry. I plan this out.

# Checklist
* Leave current file names
* Create a file checker; each new entry; one word paths?
