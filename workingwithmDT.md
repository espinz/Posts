I got a chance to deploy my first pxe-boot installation. I installed Windows 10 Enterprise on a Hyper-V virtual machine.

I would try it on a bare bone but the current set up is complicated: wifi, shared internet over thunderbolt, cross over cable. I guess what I am trying to say is that it is not connected to a switch? Wait! I just disconnect the Ethernet and connect the test unit. Maybe later.

I will document my notes on a new menu link above. I am thinking of calling it Windows and you will find it at the top soon. 

Yes, I would like consider myself a GNU/Linux guy but it seems like I'm "forced" to toggle all three: Unix/Unix-like(macOS, FreeBSD), GNU/Linux, Windows.
