Creating a todo list today. I need to get some projects off of my mind and focus on what projects I shouldn't be starting or serve as a distraction.

It all started when I seen the raspberry pi today. It looks so lonely. So, I have decided to start some fall ~cleaning~ sweeping: removing unused equipment away from eye sight. I am not currently using the raspberry so it would be best to clear it away.

Speaking of clearing away, now that summer is officially done, 2019 is quickly coming to an end. We are entering the last quarter. So sorry raspberry. Same to you networking. Must finish off strong! Back to Linux+ for the rest of the year!

# The Goal for 2019
* Complete CompTIA Linux+
* Start CompTIA A+

# The Goal for 2020
* Start CCNA R/S
