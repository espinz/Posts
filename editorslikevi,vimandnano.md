This week is all about editors: I am studying nano and vim. I do not have much to report on besides that.

I already know most of the basics in regards to vim. Nano — I know nothing. Most of the commands are at the bottom but in order to prepare myself for compTIA's Linux+ I really should know them both like the back of my hand; I really don't know what the back of my hand looks like but I hope that makes sense. 

Actually, I write all my blog post in vim. Ever since my first post — all in vim. All my studying is done in GNU Emacs. I am thankful they don't test for GNU Emacs because the learning curve on that one, at least for me, is very steep; I constantly have a cheat sheet near by every time I open it. Which is always because it is a program that is always open on my system.
