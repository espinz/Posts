Does it work? Yes it does! When this site hits the storage limit, I will rethink the image hosting. Right now, the images are hitting firebase, unsplash and github.

Why so ~~serious~~ many? I don't know? I was testing my options. On second thought, I might not need save so many images. I will remove, or rotate, all images from posts that are about a couple weeks old.
