Coding, for me, is kind of like swimming. Your head goes under ~code~ water, then you come back up for air. While underneath, you flow.

Not to long ago, like yesterday, I felt really cool: my scripts were getting really long. Then when I was out of the ~logic~ water for a while and getting back into the ~logic~ water felt like a task; trying to swim in a pool with so many objects. I say all that to say this â€” I am understanding the importance of functions. I would rather have bite size functions than long winded one shots. I will have to refine these long winded functions into something more manageable. Honestly, somethings it is hard to resist because gluing together shell commands into shell scripts makes me feel like I am doing something importantly great.

```sh
functions(){
    # are cool; use more
}
```
