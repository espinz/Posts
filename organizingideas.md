Lightly going over some todos. Seems like I have to many things on my mind so I will have to do a brain dump either this month or soon. Also I would like to create a new schedule so that I can start up some summer projects. I have a video of my playing with a raspberry pi but I haven't setup of videos yet. I might wait until mid month to start videos.
