I been thinking about the layout of the default jekyll theme. I wanted to list all my tags and change the font sizes. I wanted some tags with alternating fonts sizes. I did not know why some tags have a larger fonts and why some have a smaller fonts until I ran across Hexo.

It seems like the more tags associated with that tag will have a bigger font: have ten tags under bash? Then size 10 font for the bash tag. Five tags under shell? Size 5 for shell tag. I love it.
