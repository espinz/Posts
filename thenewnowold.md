My little "Secret"

<!-- more -->

{%gist 462548d4b5886ce12c41eb422a0dae8b %}

Actually, this script has been abandon for something a little more ... involved.

Currently working on it. How involved?

Emacs, Org mode, Jekyll, GitHub, and some custom Elisp.

This one might take awhile.

Update: Emacs will be used on my personal computer but I am looking for a new method... again.
